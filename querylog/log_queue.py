    """A queue of records that still need to be written out.

    For efficiency's sake, records are grouped into time windows of
    'batch_window_s' seconds (say, 5 minutes). x'es below indicate
    log record events:

          300               600               900
         |   x    x x      |             x   |

        wake               wake              wake

    Upon 'wake' events (every batch window seconds), a background thread
    wakes up and collects all events from previous time windows.

    We need to use a mutex since the dict we keep the queue in is not
    thread-safe. We do as little work as possible every time we hold the mutex
    to allow for maximum parallelism.
